## observations 
for a certain kind of maze, there seems to be a kind of being stuck in a loop where one doesn't get to a goal. I think that one can resolve this. Can a neural network help with this? I think, just try one out and see. 

## principles 
move quick
decide on one thing and follow up on that to completion. try to move quick 
move back to the basic problems of the maze. It is quite a rich place and has a bunch of interesting stuff that one might not have discovered had they dimissed it
